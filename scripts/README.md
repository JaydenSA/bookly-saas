## Prerequisites

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure your `MONGODB_URI` environment variable is set correctly
2. **Database Access**: Make sure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible
3. **Environment Setup**: Your `.env.local` file should contain the MongoDB connection string

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This script will **DELETE ALL EXISTING DATA** in your database before populating it with sample data. Make sure you're running this on a development database, not production!

## Usage

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Run the population script** (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run populate-db:ts
   ```

3. **Visit your admin panel**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin` to see the populated data

## Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Add more sample data
- Change business details
- Adjust pricing and services
- Add different user roles
- Modify booking dates and statuses

The script is designed to be easily customizable - just edit the arrays in the `populateDatabase()` function.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Connection Error**: Check your `MONGODB_URI` environment variable
2. **Permission Error**: Ensure your MongoDB user has read/write permissions
3. **Schema Validation Error**: Make sure your models match the data structure in the script

### Need Help?

If you encounter any issues, check:
- Your MongoDB connection string
- Database permissions
- Model schema definitions
- Environment variable configuration
